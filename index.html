		It is widely known that, along the years, the role played by women was strongly dependant on a male-dominant society. As a consequence, women were discouraged to develop certain skills or to take part in certain events. One of such prohibited activities was the practice of sports, and that is precisely what we are going to discuss along these lines. In particular, we are going to illustrate the female participation in the Olympic Games and, even more specifically, in the athletics event. If it is true that the Olympic Games has an ancient origin, women were not allowed to participate until the year 1928. As you may guess, they did not take part in all disciplines the same year since not all of them equally "welcomed" female presence. However, do not panic within this old sexist setting since, fortunately, the situation is completely different nowadays. Currently, women can feel free to decide whether they want to practice sport and to choose the one that best fits them. Let us now illustrate what we have been saying by observing the following charts.
