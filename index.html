        It is widely known that, along the years, the role played by women was strongly dependant on a male-dominant society. As a consequence, women were discouraged to develop certain skills or to take part in certain events. One of such prohibited activities was the practice of sports, and that is precisely what we are going to discuss along these lines. In particular, we are going to illustrate the female participation in the Olympic Games and, even more specifically, in the athletics event. If it is true that the Olympic Games has an ancient origin, women were not allowed to participate until the year 1928. As you may guess, they did not take part in all disciplines the same year since not all of them equally "welcomed" female presence. However, do not panic within this old sexist setting since, fortunately, the situation is completely different nowadays. Currently, women can feel free to decide whether they want to practice sport and to choose the one that best fits them. Let us now illustrate what we have been saying by observing the following charts.

        In the first image, we can see that the pioneer sports allowing a female category were <i>Swimming</i>, <i>Diving</i>, <i>Athletics</i>, <i>Gymnastics</i>, <i>Fencing</i> and <i>Sailing</i>. It is worth saying that the participation in the first two sports was about 40%, which is quite high considering the fact that it was the first year they were allowed to compete. 44 years later, in the 1972, only 5 more sports welcomed a female category. Let us now say that <i>Sailing</i>, which appeared in 1928, was not regarded as an Olympic sport anymore. Despite this small improvement, we can see that the female participation in such disciplines was quite high. Observe that, from <i>Diving</i> to <i>Volleyball</i>, women almost equalled men. Finally, the last chart depicts the participation in 2016 for the 15 sports with higher female presence. Fortunately, in such year, all sports had a female category. The first aspect that stands out from such image is the fact that there are two sports with no male category, which are <i>Rhythmic Gymnastics</i> and <i>Synchronized Swimming</i>. Besides, the rest of the disciplines appearing in the bar chart have almost the same percentage of female and male participants. This leads us to think that sport is, by no means, a male-dominated world.

        So far, we have seen the particular cases of participation in some specific years, which give us an idea of how women were introduced in the Olympic Games competition. So, let us now give a general picture of the female participation along the years, which is one of our points of interest. The below chart shows the percentage of the participation of men against women along the different celebrations of the Games regardless of the discipline.

Although the difference between genders was vast at the beginning, it has been diminishing since the 60's. From that year, female participation has increased until it almost reached a 50% of the total participation. So, a message of hope and encouragement can be inferred from that image. Sport is no longer a male-dominant world.

        Athletics events have their roots in the ancient Greek Olympic games, which were festivals composed only of athletic competitions. These ancient Olympics were strictly male affairs, as to both participants and spectators. However, Greek women formed their own <a href="https://healthandfitnesshistory.com/historical-athletes/ancient-heraean-games/">Heraea Games</a>, which, like the Olympics, were held every four years.
        </p>

        <p id="txt1">
        The development of the modern sport, however, started in the early 19th century, but not until the revival of the Olympic Games in 1896 did the sport become truly international. Even though Athletics has been part of the Olympics since its birth, it was not until 1928 that women could take part in the competition. The evolution of men and women participation in the games is shown in the following chart.

        The previous figure shows that since the arrival of women in the competition, their participation increased noticeably, until almost matching the men participation in 2016. Hence, just as it happened in the ancient Greece, Athletics is not a male-dominant sport anymore. It can also be noticed from the previous chart that there are some recession periods, where the overall participation decreased significantly. The first two periods correspond to the first and second world war respectively. The third period corresponds to the 1980-1984 summer Olympics boycott, where the USA initiated a protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

          The previous chart shows that women participation in athletics is present in almost every single country. The women participation is specially significant in some large countries such as USA and China, which is expectable since the total participation is also high. On the other hand, there are smaller countries with noticeable participation, such as the UK, Germany and France. The majority of these countries belong to Europe, which is the continent with more involvement in this sport. Apart from the participation, it is also interesting to see which are the most competitive countries. The following chart shows the top three countries where women have won more medals.

  After all the analysis done so far, it cannot be denied the fact that women play an important role in worldwide sport and, in particular, in athletics. If it is true that, globally speaking, male participation is still higher than the female one, such different is very small and, more than this, it is decreasing with each passing year. The prove is the fact that, in Europe, there are more female than male athletes. Despite this good tendency, it cannot be denied the fact that, here in Spain, athletics still has more male representatives since women only account for a third of the total participation. However, this fact does not have to discourage anybody. Undoubtedly, more has to be done in order to change these numbers of participation and, the only way of doing so, is by getting girls more involved in athletics. Our country needs brave girls willing to work hard so as to place Spanish female athletics in the world map.
